**Lead Developer: [Your Name]**  
*Commissioned by: Mr. Robinson*

This high-performance web experience was custom-built for Mr. Robinson to showcase his status as the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) and to "officially" announce his new English class policies.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
I engineered this project from the ground up using **Vanilla HTML5 and CSS3** to ensure smooth animations and a professional broadcast feel.

### **Key Features Developed:**
*   **Parade Engine:** A 40-second synchronized animation loop I designed to keep 5 unique floats perfectly spaced across a 300% viewport width.
*   **Broadcast UI:** An ESPN-style "Robinson Network" overlay featuring a multi-layered z-index system.
*   **Dynamic Ticker:** A scrolling news feed that flows *behind* the red "Breaking News" header for a realistic TV broadcast effect.
*   **Custom Assets:**
    *   **Recess Asker #532:** A CSS-generated jail cell for rule-breakers.
    *   **Infinite Chalkboard:** A vertical-scrolling punishment board with cursive typography.
    *   **Service Fleet:** The Grammar Police, "Robinson's Fuel" (Coffee), and the Homework Squad.

## 🛠️ Performance Fixes
*   **The "Stacking" Bug:** I successfully re-calibrated the animation-delay math to prevent floats from overlapping on their second lap.
*   **Responsive Scaling:** The layout is designed to work on both classroom smartboards and mobile devices.
